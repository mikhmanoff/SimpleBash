The room looks unusual. A computer with an 
old dot matrix printer and a stack of yellowed paper 
        is standing on the floor right in the middle of the room, a
s if someone measured out its location. Next to it is a crumpled cushion, a saucer for cookies (wh
    ich is obvious from the abundance of crumbs), and a long-finished cup of tea (which is a    
    lso obvious from a dried-up teabag). The floor and the walls are cover
    ed with an even layer of sheets of paper with numbers on them. Red threads 
    are stretched over the paper. It all looks like a spy movie.
